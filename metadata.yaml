description: "Rilla of Ingleside (1921) is the eighth of nine books in the Anne of\
  \ Green Gables series by Lucy Maud Montgomery, but was the sixth \"Anne\" novel\
  \ in publication order. This book draws the focus back onto a single character,\
  \ Anne and Gilbert's youngest daughter Bertha Marilla \"Rilla\" Blythe. It has a\
  \ more serious tone, as it takes place during World War I and the three Blythe boys—Jem,\
  \ Walter, and Shirley—along with Rilla's sweetheart Ken Ford, and playmates Jerry\
  \ Meredith and Carl Meredith—end up fighting in Europe with the Canadian Expeditionary\
  \ Force.\nThe book is dedicated: \"To the memory of FREDERICA CAMPBELL MACFARLANE\
  \ who went away from me when the dawn broke on January 25, 1919 -- a true friend,\
  \ a rare personality, a loyal and courageous soul.\" Frederica, Maud's cousin and\
  \ best friend, grew up in Park Corner, PEI, but died in the worldwide flu epidemic\
  \ of 1918/19. Frederica may have been the model for Diana Barry, Anne of Green Gables'\
  \ \"bosom friend\": both had unusual, non-Christian first names, and the fictional\
  \ Diana's husband was named, perhaps not coincidentally, Fred.\nRilla of Ingleside\
  \ is the only Canadian novel written from a woman's perspective about the First\
  \ World War by a contemporary. The novel is also groundbreaking as it is one of\
  \ the first non-Australian texts to mention the Gallipoli campaign and the sacrifice\
  \ made by the ANZACs.\nAt some point after Montgomery's death in 1942, publishers\
  \ quietly trimmed Rilla of Ingleside of a few thousand words, removing among other\
  \ things passages containing historically accurate but now offensive anti-German\
  \ sentiment. The trimmed version was the only available \"in print\" version for\
  \ decades, until a new, restored and annotated edition of Rilla of Ingleside, edited\
  \ by Benjamin Lefebvre (editor of Montgomery's The Blythes Are Quoted) and Andrea\
  \ McKenzie, was published by Viking Canada in October 2010.\n From Wikipedia (CC\
